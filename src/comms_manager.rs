//! This module provides mechanisms for sending bytes to an amplifier and receiving bytes from
//! an amplifier.
//!
//! Everything here is asynchronous communication with the amplifier. Communication into here
//! and out of here is using channels. The channel for sending bytes from the amplifier to other
//! code is provided via a call to the [connect_to_amp](fn.connect_to_amp.html) which returns
//! the channel for sending bytes to the amplifier.
//!
//! There is no knowledge of the Arcam protocol here, everything is just byte sequences. The
//! module [functionality](../functionality/index.html) has the functions that transform Arcam
//! [Requests](../arcam_protocol/struct.Request.html) into byte sequences that can be sent by by
//! code here and the functions that parse byte sequences into Arcam
//! [Response](../arcam_protocol/struct.Response.html)s.
